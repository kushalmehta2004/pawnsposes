- Missing: `💾 Storing puzzles with FULL DATA...`
- See: `⚠️ Missing userId or reportId`

## 📊 Database Verification

After seeing all logs, verify in Supabase:

### Check Reports Table:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  user_id,
  subscription_tier,
  is_weekly_report,
  week_number,
  year,
  created_at
FROM reports
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
user_id: [your-user-id]
subscription_tier: free
is_weekly_report: true
week_number: 47
year: 2024
created_at: 2024-11-20 10:30:00
```

---

### Check Puzzles Table:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  report_id,
  puzzle_type,
  is_weekly_puzzle,
  week_number,
  year,
  puzzle_data IS NOT NULL as has_full_data,
  created_at
FROM puzzles
WHERE report_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
id: [uuid]
report_id: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
puzzle_type: weakness
is_weekly_puzzle: true
week_number: 47
year: 2024
has_full_data: true
created_at: 2024-11-20 10:30:05
```

---

### Check Usage Counter:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  reports_generated,
  subscription_tier
FROM user_profiles
WHERE id = '[your-user-id]';
```

**Expected Result:**
```
id: [your-user-id]
email: your@email.com
reports_generated: 1  ← Should increment each time
subscription_tier: free
```
