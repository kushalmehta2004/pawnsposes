## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still taking 2+ minutes
**Possible causes:**
1. Stockfish not initialized properly
2. Browser throttling background tabs
3. Slow CPU

**Solution:** Check console for Stockfish errors

### Issue: Less than 30 puzzles generated
**Possible causes:**
1. Not enough stored mistakes (need 50+)
2. Positions are endgames (can't extend)

**Solution:** Check console for "Only generated X puzzles" warning

### Issue: Puzzles too short (1-2 plies)
**This shouldn't happen** - minimum is 4 plies. If it does:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `MINIMUM_PLIES = 4` in code

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to the previous version:

1. Open `src/services/puzzleGenerationService.js`
2. Change these values:

```javascript
// Line 148-149:
const MINIMUM_PLIES = 12;  // Was 4
const TARGET_PLIES = 14;   // Was 8

// Line 347-348:
const firstTime = 2000;    // Was 800
const nextTime = 1500;     // Was 600

// Line 352:
const analysis = await stockfishAnalyzer.analyzePositionDeep(curFen, 15, timeBudget);  // Was 12
```

3. Save and reload

## 📝 Notes

- **4 plies = 2 full moves** (player → opponent → player → opponent)
- This is still a **multi-move puzzle**, not a one-move puzzle
- Quality is maintained - Stockfish depth 12 is still very strong
- Most tactical puzzles (forks, pins, skewers) are 2-4 moves anyway

## ✅ Ready to Test!

Just clear cache and generate puzzles. Should take **30-60 seconds** for 30 puzzles! 🚀
