2. Navigate to "Learn From Mistakes"
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Check IndexedDB in DevTools

**Expected Results:**
- Old cache key: `pawnsposes:puzzles:[username]:learn-mistakes:v3-fill20`
- New cache key: `pawnsposes:puzzles:[username]:learn-mistakes:v4-multi30`
- Console shows puzzle generation (not loading from cache)

**Verification:**
- [ ] Old cache is ignored
- [ ] New puzzles are generated
- [ ] New cache is created with v4-multi30 key
- [ ] All new puzzles have 12+ plies

## 🔍 DETAILED VERIFICATION STEPS

### Verify Multi-Move Sequences:

1. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Navigate to Console tab**
3. **After puzzle generation, run:**
   ```javascript
   // Get puzzles from state (if accessible)
   // Or inspect puzzle objects in console logs
   ```
4. **For each puzzle, verify:**
   - `lineUci` field exists
   - `lineUci` contains space-separated UCI moves
   - Count moves: `lineUci.split(' ').length >= 12`
   - All moves are valid UCI format: `/^[a-h][1-8][a-h][1-8](?:[qrbn])?$/`

### Verify Stockfish Integration:

1. **Check console for Stockfish analysis logs**
2. **Look for:**
   - `analyzePositionDeep` calls
   - Principal variation (PV) extraction
   - Best move recommendations
3. **Verify:**
   - Analysis depth is 22
   - Time budgets are 3000ms (first) and 1500ms (subsequent)
   - PV is used to build move sequences

### Verify UI Compatibility:

1. **Start a puzzle**
2. **Make the first correct move**
3. **Observe:**
   - Opponent move auto-plays
   - Position updates
   - Feedback shows "Good move: [move]. Keep going!"
4. **Continue making correct moves**
5. **Verify:**
   - Each move is validated against `lineUci` sequence
   - Puzzle completes after all moves played
   - Completion message appears: "🎉 Congratulations! You completed the puzzle."

## 📊 METRICS TO TRACK

### Quantitative Metrics:
- **Puzzle Count:** Should be 30 (or close with warning)
- **Ply Count:** All puzzles should have 12-14 plies
- **Generation Time:** Should be <5 minutes
- **Success Rate:** % of positions that generate valid puzzles
- **Reuse Rate:** How often reuse mechanism is triggered
- **Skip Rate:** How many positions are skipped

### Qualitative Metrics:
- **User Experience:** Puzzles feel challenging and realistic
- **Difficulty Progression:** Easy → Medium → Hard feels natural
- **Move Validation:** UI correctly validates multi-move sequences
- **Feedback Quality:** Messages are clear and helpful

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: Fewer than 30 puzzles generated
**Possible Causes:**
- User has insufficient stored mistakes
- Many positions don't support multi-move lines (endgames)
- Stockfish analysis failing

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Check console for "dropping puzzle" warnings
2. Verify reuse mechanism activated
3. Check Stockfish is loaded and working
4. Review mistake positions in IndexedDB

### Issue 2: Single-move puzzles appear
**Possible Causes:**
- Critical bug in filtering logic
- `lineUci` field not properly set

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Inspect puzzle object in console
2. Check `lineUci` field length
3. Verify filtering logic at line 460-464
4. Report as critical bug

### Issue 3: Puzzle generation takes too long
**Possible Causes:**
- Too many Stockfish analyses
- Slow Stockfish engine
- Network latency (if remote)

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Monitor console for analysis times
2. Check Stockfish performance
3. Consider reducing time budgets
4. Implement progress indicator

### Issue 4: UI doesn't validate moves correctly
**Possible Causes:**
- `lineUci` format incorrect
- `lineIndex` not updating
- UCI move parsing failing

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Inspect puzzle object during play
2. Check `lineUci` format (space-separated UCI)
3. Verify `lineIndex` increments correctly
4. Test UCI move validation logic
