# Phase 3 Database Queries - Quick Reference

This document contains useful SQL queries for testing and monitoring the puzzle access control system.

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check if Tables Exist

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('reports', 'puzzles', 'puzzle_unlocks', 'puzzle_progress')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Expected Output:**
- puzzle_progress
- puzzle_unlocks
- puzzles
- reports

### Check Current User

```sql
SELECT auth.uid() as current_user_id;
```

### View All Tables and Row Counts

```sql
SELECT 
  'reports' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM reports
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'puzzles' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM puzzles
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'puzzle_unlocks' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM puzzle_unlocks
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'puzzle_progress' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM puzzle_progress;
```

## üìä Reports Queries

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  username,
  platform,
  title,
  game_count,

```

### View Reports for Specific User

```sql
-- Replace [user_id] with actual UUID
SELECT 
  id,
  username,
  platform,
  title,
  game_count,
  created_at
FROM reports
WHERE user_id = '[user_id]'::uuid
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### View Report with Puzzle Count

```sql
SELECT 
  r.id,
  r.username,
  r.platform,
  r.title,
  r.game_count,

SELECT get_accessible_puzzle_count('[user_id]'::uuid, 'opening') as opening_count;
SELECT get_accessible_puzzle_count('[user_id]'::uuid, 'endgame') as endgame_count;
```

**Expected:** 1 per category for free users (teaser puzzles)

## üßπ Cleanup Queries (Use with Caution!)

### Delete All Puzzles for a User

```sql
-- Replace [user_id] with actual UUID
-- WARNING: This will permanently delete all puzzles!
DELETE FROM puzzles WHERE user_id = '[user_id]'::uuid;
```

### Delete All Reports for a User

```sql
-- Replace [user_id] with actual UUID
-- WARNING: This will cascade delete all associated puzzles!
DELETE FROM reports WHERE user_id = '[user_id]'::uuid;
```

### Delete All Progress for a User

```sql
-- Replace [user_id] with actual UUID
-- WARNING: This will permanently delete all progress!
DELETE FROM puzzle_progress WHERE user_id = '[user_id]'::uuid;
```

### Reset Puzzle Locks (for Testing)

```sql
-- Replace [user_id] with actual UUID
-- This will lock all puzzles except teasers
UPDATE puzzles 
SET is_locked = true 
WHERE user_id = '[user_id]'::uuid 
AND is_teaser = false;
```

### Mark All Puzzles as Unlocked (for Testing)

```sql
-- Replace [user_id] with actual UUID
-- This will unlock all puzzles for testing
UPDATE puzzles 
SET is_locked = false 
WHERE user_id = '[user_id]'::uuid;
```

## üìä Analytics Queries

    WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM puzzle_unlocks WHERE unlock_type = 'subscription')
  ) as users_with_subscription,
  SUM(payment_amount) as total_revenue
FROM puzzle_unlocks;
```

## üîç Debugging Queries

### Find Puzzles Without Teasers

```sql
-- This should return empty if teaser logic is working correctly
SELECT 
  user_id,
  report_id,
  category,
  COUNT(*) as puzzle_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_teaser = true) as teaser_count
FROM puzzles
GROUP BY user_id, report_id, category
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_teaser = true) = 0;
```

### Find Categories with Multiple Teasers

```sql
-- This should return empty if teaser logic is working correctly (max 1 per category)
SELECT 
  user_id,
  report_id,
  category,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_teaser = true) as teaser_count
FROM puzzles
GROUP BY user_id, report_id, category
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_teaser = true) > 1;
```

### Find Unlocked Puzzles That Are Still Marked as Locked

```sql
-- This should return empty if unlock logic is working correctly
SELECT 
  p.id,
  p.user_id,
  p.report_id,
  p.category,
  p.is_locked,
  pu.unlock_type
FROM puzzles p
JOIN puzzle_unlocks pu ON pu.report_id = p.report_id AND pu.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE p.is_locked = true
AND pu.unlock_type = 'one_time_pack';
```

### Check RLS Policies

```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('reports', 'puzzles', 'puzzle_unlocks', 'puzzle_progress')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Replace Placeholders**: Always replace `[user_id]`, `[report_id]`, and `[puzzle_id]` with actual UUIDs
2. **Use auth.uid()**: In Supabase SQL Editor, `auth.uid()` returns the current authenticated user's ID
3. **Test with Your User**: Use `SELECT auth.uid()` to get your user ID for testing
4. **Check RLS**: If queries return empty results, check if RLS policies are blocking access
5. **Use Transactions**: For cleanup queries, wrap in `BEGIN; ... ROLLBACK;` to test before committing

## üÜò Common Issues

### "No rows returned" when data should exist

**Cause**: RLS policies blocking access

**Solution**: Check if you're authenticated and the user_id matches:
```sql
SELECT auth.uid(); -- Should return your user ID
SELECT * FROM reports WHERE user_id = auth.uid(); -- Should return your reports
```

### "Function does not exist"

**Cause**: Helper functions not created

**Solution**: Run `database-puzzles-setup.sql` to create functions

### "Relation does not exist"

**Cause**: Tables not created

**Solution**: Run `database-setup.sql` and `database-puzzles-setup.sql`
