# 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE: Multi-Move Puzzle System

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### What Changed?
The "Learn From Mistakes" puzzle generation system now **enforces multi-move puzzles** based on Stockfish analysis.

### Key Numbers
- **Minimum Puzzles:** 30
- **Minimum Plies per Puzzle:** 12 (6 moves)
- **Target Plies per Puzzle:** 14 (7 moves)
- **Stockfish Analysis Depth:** 22
- **Analysis Time:** 1000-3000ms per position

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Constants (Line 147-149)
```javascript
const MINIMUM_PUZZLES = 30;  // Target puzzle count
const MINIMUM_PLIES = 12;    // Minimum moves in sequence
const TARGET_PLIES = 14;     // Ideal moves in sequence
```

### Critical Logic Points

#### 1. Strict Filtering (Line 460-464)
```javascript
if (line.length < targetMin) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ Dropping puzzle due to insufficient line length`);
  continue; // Skip puzzle entirely - NO single-move puzzles
}
```

#### 2. Reuse Mechanism (Line 484-531)
```javascript
if (enhanced.length < MINIMUM_PUZZLES) {
  // Try to reuse other valid mistake positions
  // Still enforces 12+ ply requirement
}
```

#### 3. Cache Version (ReportDisplay.js Line 38)
```javascript
const version = 'v4-multi30'; // Invalidates old cache
```

#### 4. Puzzle Count (ReportDisplay.js Line 47)
```javascript
generateMistakePuzzles(username, { maxPuzzles: 30 })
```

## 🎮 USER EXPERIENCE

### Before (Old System)
- ❌ Some single-move puzzles
- ❌ Only 20 puzzles
- ❌ Inconsistent multi-move sequences

### After (New System)
- ✅ All puzzles are multi-move (12-14 plies)
- ✅ Minimum 30 puzzles
- ✅ All moves from Stockfish PV
- ✅ Sorted by difficulty (easy → medium → hard)

---

## 🧪 TESTING COMMANDS

### Clear Cache and Test Fresh Generation
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('PuzzleDatabase');
location.reload();
```

### Check Puzzle Data
```javascript
// In browser console after puzzles load:
const db = await indexedDB.open('PuzzleDatabase');
// Inspect stored puzzles
```

### Monitor Generation Progress
```javascript
// Watch console logs for:
// "🧩 Generating 30+ multi-move mistake-based puzzles..."
// "✅ Generated multi-move puzzle X/30 with Y plies"
// "✅ Successfully generated Z multi-move mistake-based puzzles"
```

## 📊 DATA FORMAT

### Puzzle Object Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "mistake-1234567890",
  position: "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1",
  lineUci: "e2e4 e7e5 g1f3 b8c6 f1c4 f8c5 c2c3 g8f6",
  userColor: "white",
  difficulty: "easy",
  rating: 1650,
  source: "user_game",
  startLineIndex: 0
}
```

### Key Fields
- **lineUci:** Space-separated UCI moves (12-14 moves)
- **position:** Starting FEN position
- **userColor:** Which side the user plays
- **difficulty:** easy (1500-1800) | medium (1800-2200) | hard (2200-2600)

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Fewer than 30 puzzles generated
**Cause:** User has limited mistakes, or many positions don't support 12+ ply lines
**Solution:** System will log warnings and generate as many as possible
**Check:** Console logs for "⚠️ Only generated X puzzles"

### Issue: Generation takes too long
**Cause:** Stockfish analysis is computationally intensive
**Expected:** 2-5 minutes for 30 puzzles on first generation
**Solution:** Results are cached - subsequent loads are instant

### Issue: Old puzzles still showing
**Cause:** Cache not invalidated
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and IndexedDB (see testing commands above)

### Issue: Puzzle won't accept correct move
**Cause:** UI expects exact UCI move from lineUci sequence
**Solution:** Verify move matches the next move in the sequence
**Check:** Console logs for move validation

- Enhanced all fallback paths with multi-move requirements
- Increased mistake fetch from 100 to 200
- Updated interleaving to request 2x more positions

### 2. ReportDisplay.js (Lines 38, 47)
**Changes:**
- Cache version: 'v3-fill20' → 'v4-multi30'
- maxPuzzles parameter: 20 → 30

## 📞 SUPPORT

### Console Logs to Monitor
```
🧩 Generating 30+ multi-move mistake-based puzzles...
✅ Generated multi-move puzzle 1/30 with 12 plies
✅ Generated multi-move puzzle 2/30 with 14 plies
...
