# Quick Reference Guide

## What Changed?

### 1. Lichess Integration ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/pages/FullReport.js`

**What it does**: Clicking "Analyze on Lichess" now opens the position directly on Lichess's analysis board instead of showing a static modal.

**How to test**: 
```
1. Generate a report
2. Find any weakness example
3. Click "Analyze on Lichess" button
4. Verify Lichess opens with correct position
```

---

### 2. Enhanced Stockfish-Gemini Analysis ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/utils/geminiStockfishAnalysis.js`

**What it does**: Gemini now receives Stockfish's best move and explains WHY it's superior, providing strategic context.

**How to test**:
```
1. Generate a report
2. Look at "Better Plan" explanations
3. Verify they reference specific strategic concepts
4. Check console for enhancement logs (üîç, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)
```

---

### 3. Gemini Hallucination Fix ‚úÖ
**File**: `src/utils/geminiStockfishAnalysis.js`

**What it does**: Prevents Gemini from suggesting illegal/impossible moves by constraining it to explain concepts only.

**How to test**:
```
1. Generate a report
2. Read all "Better Plan" explanations
3. Verify NO additional moves are suggested
4. Confirm focus is on strategic ideas, not move sequences
```

---

## Key Technical Changes

### Prompt Engineering
```javascript
// Added explicit constraints
CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT suggest any additional moves beyond ${example.betterMove}
- DO NOT use chess notation like Nf3, Qd5, etc. in explanations
- Focus on CONCEPTS: "controls the center", "activates the rook"
```

### Temperature Reduction
```javascript
// Before: temperature: 0.6
// After:  temperature: 0.3
// Result: Less creative, more focused, fewer hallucinations
```

### Lichess URL Format
```javascript
// Correct: Replace spaces with underscores
const fenForLichess = example.fen.replace(/ /g, '_');
window.open(`https://lichess.org/analysis/${fenForLichess}`, '_blank');
```

## Console Logs to Watch For

### Enhancement Process
```
üéØ STARTING EXAMPLE GROUNDING FOR 3 WEAKNESSES
üìã Processing weakness 1: "Premature Pawn Advances"
üîç Enhancing example: Game 5, Move 18
‚úÖ Enhanced with Gemini explanation
```

### Success Indicators
```
‚úÖ Weakness "..." processed with 3 enhanced examples
‚úÖ GAME DIVERSITY VALIDATED
üìä SUMMARY: Total weaknesses: 3, Total examples: 9
```

### Error Indicators
```
‚ùå Gemini API error: 429
‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping: Missing betterMove or FEN
‚ö†Ô∏è DUPLICATE GAME DETECTED
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
Better Plan: Nf3 (Develops the knight. Follow up with Qd2 and O-O-O.)
```
‚ùå Suggests additional moves that may not be legal

### After Fix
```
Better Plan: Nf3 (Develops the knight to a central square, controls e5 and d4, and prepares kingside castling.)
```
‚úÖ Only explains strategic ideas

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Report Generation | 10-20s | 15-35s | +5-15s |
| Gemini API Calls | 1-2 | 4-11 | +3-9 |
| Code Lines (FullReport.js) | ~2100 | ~2000 | -100 |
| Explanation Quality | Generic | Specific | ‚úÖ Better |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Lichess opens but wrong position
**Solution**: Check FEN string format - spaces should be underscores

### Issue: No "Better Plan" explanations
**Solution**: Check console for Gemini API errors, verify API key

### Issue: Still seeing illegal moves suggested
**Solution**: 
1. Verify temperature is 0.3 (not 0.6)
2. Check "CRITICAL RULES" section is in prompt
3. Review console logs for enhancement failures

### Issue: Report generation too slow
**Solution**: 
1. Reduce number of examples per weakness
2. Consider caching Gemini responses
3. Check network latency to Gemini API

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Lichess Integration**
- [ ] Button opens Lichess in new tab
- [ ] Correct position loads
- [ ] Stockfish analysis available

‚úÖ **Enhanced Analysis**
- [ ] Explanations reference Stockfish's move
- [ ] Strategic concepts mentioned
- [ ] Specific squares/pieces referenced

‚úÖ **No Hallucinations**
- [ ] No illegal moves suggested
- [ ] No additional moves beyond Stockfish's

## API Cost Estimate

### Before
- 1-2 Gemini calls per report
- ~$0.001-0.002 per report (estimated)

### After
- 4-11 Gemini calls per report
- ~$0.004-0.011 per report (estimated)

**Note**: Actual costs depend on Gemini API pricing and token usage.
