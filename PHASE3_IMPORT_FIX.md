# Phase 3 Import Path Fix

## Issue
The build was failing with module not found errors:
```
ERROR in ./src/services/puzzleAccessService.js 8:0-52
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../config/supabaseClient' in 'D:\pawns-poses\src\services'

ERROR in ./src/services/reportService.js 8:0-52
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../config/supabaseClient' in 'D:\pawns-poses\src\services'
```

## Root Cause
The service files were trying to import from `../config/supabaseClient`, but the Supabase client is actually located at `src/services/supabaseClient.js`.

## Fix Applied
Updated import paths in both service files:

### Before:
```javascript
import { supabase } from '../config/supabaseClient';
```

### After:
```javascript
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient';
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/puzzleAccessService.js` - Line 6
2. `src/services/reportService.js` - Line 6

## Verification
The Supabase client configuration is correctly set up:
- ✅ File exists: `src/services/supabaseClient.js`
- ✅ Environment variables configured in `.env`:
  - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Next Steps
1. The build should now compile successfully
2. Test report generation to verify Supabase integration works
3. Check browser console for success messages:
   - `✅ Report saved to Supabase with ID: [uuid]`
   - `✅ Stored [N] puzzles in Supabase with access control`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Can generate a report
- [ ] Report is saved to Supabase (check console logs)
- [ ] Puzzles are stored in Supabase (check console logs)
- [ ] Verify data in Supabase dashboard using queries from `PHASE3_DATABASE_QUERIES.md`
