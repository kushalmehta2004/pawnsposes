### PHASE 2: Verify PuzzlePage Storage (1 minute)

**Step 1**: Navigate to First Puzzle Page
```
1. From Dashboard or report view, click "Fix My Weaknesses"
2. Wait for puzzles to load
3. Note the first puzzle's details (rating, themes)
   Example: 
   - ID: PUZZLE_1234
   - Rating: 2208
   - Themes: "fork", "pin"
```

**Step 2**: Check Console Logs
```
Open DevTools Console (F12 → Console tab)

LOOK FOR THESE MESSAGES:
✅ Successfully loaded [N] unique puzzles shards (Type: fix-weaknesses)
💾 Storing displayed puzzles to Supabase for fix-weaknesses...
✅ Stored [N] puzzles to Supabase for Dashboard synchronization
```

If you see these logs → **PASS** ✅

If you see "⚠️ Could not find report ID" → **ISSUE**: No reports in database
- Solution: Make sure you generated a report first

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No puzzles found for category"

**Symptoms**:
- Dashboard shows empty category
- Console: `⚠️ No puzzles found for report ...`

**Causes**:
1. Puzzles never stored (PuzzlePage storage failed)
2. Wrong report_id
3. No reports in database

**Solutions**:
```
1. Check console when visiting puzzle page:
   - Should see "💾 Storing X puzzles..."
   - If not, report_id is null
   
2. Verify report exists:
   - Check Supabase reports table
   - Ensure user has at least one report

3. Manual fix:
   - Delete puzzles from Supabase
   - Visit puzzle page again
   - Should re-store with correct report_id
```

---

### Issue: "Puzzle ratings don't match between pages"

**Symptoms**:
- PuzzlePage shows rating 2208
- Dashboard shows rating 1500

**Causes**:
1. puzzle_data not stored correctly
2. Extraction logic bug
3. Data corruption

**Solutions**:
```
1. Check Supabase directly:
   - Query puzzles table
   - Check puzzle_data column
   - Verify puzzle_data.rating = 2208
   
2. If puzzle_data is null:
   - Issue with storage
   - Re-visit puzzle page
   - Should update puzzle_data
   
3. If puzzle_data has rating:
   - Issue with extraction
   - Check Dashboard console logs
   - Look for extraction failures
```

---

### Issue: "Free user sees paid puzzles"

**Symptoms**:
- Free user should see 1 puzzle
- Dashboard shows 30+ puzzles
- `is_locked` is false for all

**Causes**:
1. Incorrect free user detection
2. Wrong puzzle access tier

**Solutions**:
```
1. Check user subscription:
   - Supabase auth user profile
   - Verify subscription_type is null/free
   
2. Check puzzle storage:
   - Puzzles stored with is_locked=false
   - This is intentional (user can see them)
   - Access control happens via other means
   
3. Frontend access check:
   - Dashboard should filter by user tier
   - Not by is_locked flag
   - Verify tierBasedPuzzleService logic
```

---

### Issue: "Puzzles keep changing between visits"

**Symptoms**:
- Different puzzles each time
- Dashboard shows different puzzles than PuzzlePage
- Not deterministic

**Causes**:
1. Puzzle shuffling on each load
2. No caching
3. Random selection

**Solutions**:
```
1. Check PuzzlePage shuffling (line ~402):
   - const shuffledPuzzles = allPuzzles.slice(0, maxPuzzles)
     .sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
   - This shuffles on every load
   - BUT storage happens AFTER shuffle
   - So same shuffled set should be stored

2. Verify UPSERT is working:
   - Same puzzle_key should update not duplicate
   - Check Supabase puzzle count
   - Should be stable (not increasing)

3. Solution:
   - Add deterministic seed to shuffle
   - Or store before shuffling
```

## Database Query Reference

### Check Stored Puzzles

```sql
-- Count puzzles by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count
FROM puzzles
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
GROUP BY category;

-- View specific puzzle storage
SELECT 
  puzzle_key,
  category,
  fen,
  puzzle_data,
  created_at
FROM puzzles
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
  AND category = 'weakness'
LIMIT 5;

-- Check for null puzzle_data (storage issue)
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_count
FROM puzzles
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
  AND puzzle_data IS NULL;

-- Verify UPSERT worked (no duplicates)
SELECT puzzle_key, COUNT(*) as count
FROM puzzles
WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID_HERE'
GROUP BY puzzle_key
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Timings

| Operation | Expected Time | Max Acceptable |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Load puzzles from shards | 200-500ms | 1000ms |
| Store 60 puzzles to Supabase | 300-800ms | 2000ms |
| Fetch from Supabase (Dashboard) | 200-400ms | 1000ms |
| Extract/validate puzzles | 50-100ms | 500ms |
| Total PuzzlePage load | 500-1300ms | 3000ms |
| Total Dashboard load | 300-700ms | 2000ms |

### Measurement

```javascript
// In console, measure timing:
console.time('puzzle-storage');
// ... storage code runs ...
console.timeEnd('puzzle-storage');

// Should output: puzzle-storage: XXms
```
