# Chess Board Preview Feature - Dashboard Puzzles

## Overview
Added visual chess board previews to all puzzle cards on the Dashboard, showing a non-interactive preview of the puzzle position from the correct perspective (side to move).

## What Was Added

### 1. New Component: `ChessBoardPreview.js`
**Location**: `src/components/ChessBoardPreview.js`

A lightweight, non-interactive chess board component specifically designed for previews:

**Features:**
- ✅ Displays static chess positions from FEN strings
- ✅ Auto-detects side to move and orients board accordingly
- ✅ Configurable size (default 200px)
- ✅ Optional coordinate labels
- ✅ Uses Lichess piece set (cburnett style)
- ✅ Chess.com color scheme (#eeeed2 light, #769656 dark)
- ✅ No user interaction (perfect for previews)
- ✅ Lightweight and performant

**Props:**
```javascript
{
  position: string,           // FEN string (required)
  orientation: string,        // 'white' | 'black' | 'auto' (default: 'auto')
  size: number,              // Board size in pixels (default: 200)
  showCoordinates: boolean   // Show a-h, 1-8 labels (default: false)
}
```

**Auto-Orientation Logic:**
- When `orientation="auto"` (default), the component reads the FEN string
- Extracts whose turn it is (white or black)
- Automatically orients the board from that player's perspective
- White to move → board shown from white's perspective (white on bottom)
- Black to move → board shown from black's perspective (black on bottom)

### 2. Dashboard Integration
**Location**: `src/pages/Dashboard.js`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Import**: Added `ChessBoardPreview` component import
2. **Puzzle Cards**: Integrated board preview into each puzzle card
3. **Layout**: Preview appears between difficulty badge and puzzle description
4. **Size**: Set to 240px for optimal visibility in card layout
5. **Orientation**: Uses `"auto"` to show from side-to-move perspective

**Card Layout (Top to Bottom):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [Difficulty]        [#1]    │
│                             │
│   ┌─────────────────┐       │
│   │  Chess Board    │       │
│   │    Preview      │       │
│   └─────────────────┘       │
│                             │
│ Puzzle Description          │
│ [Theme Badge]               │
│ [Solve on Lichess Button]   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation

### FEN String Parsing
The component uses `chess.js` library to:
1. Parse the FEN string
2. Extract board position (8x8 array)
3. Determine side to move via `chess.turn()` method
4. Returns 'w' for white, 'b' for black

### Board Rendering
- **Grid Layout**: CSS Grid with 8x8 squares
- **Square Colors**: Alternating light/dark based on (row + col) % 2
- **Pieces**: SVG images from Lichess CDN
- **Orientation**: Board flips both files and ranks for black perspective

### Performance Considerations
- **Memoization**: Uses `useMemo` for chess instance and orientation
- **Lightweight**: No event listeners or interaction handlers
- **Efficient**: Only re-renders when position changes
- **CDN Images**: Pieces loaded from Lichess CDN (cached by browser)

## User Experience

### Before
- Users saw only text descriptions of puzzles
- Had to click "Solve on Lichess" to see the position
- No visual preview of what the puzzle looks like
- Difficult to browse and select interesting puzzles

### After
- ✅ Instant visual preview of each puzzle position
- ✅ Board shown from correct perspective (side to move)
- ✅ Easy to browse and identify interesting positions
- ✅ Better engagement with puzzle content
- ✅ Professional, polished appearance
- ✅ Consistent with chess platform UX standards

## Examples

### White to Move Puzzle
```
FEN: "r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3"
                                                              ^
                                                              White's turn
Result: Board shows white pieces on bottom
```

### Black to Move Puzzle
```
FEN: "r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3"
                                                              ^
                                                              Black's turn
Result: Board shows black pieces on bottom (flipped)
```
