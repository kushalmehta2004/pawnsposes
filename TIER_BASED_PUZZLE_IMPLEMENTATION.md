# Tier-Based Puzzle Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete tier-based puzzle locking system that integrates seamlessly with your existing subscription infrastructure. Free users see teasers, while paid users unlock puzzles based on their subscription tier.

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. **`tierBasedPuzzleService.js`** ‚≠ê (Main Service)
Location: `src/services/tierBasedPuzzleService.js`

**Purpose**: Core service for tier-based puzzle management

**Key Functions**:
- `filterPuzzlesByTier(userId, puzzles)` - Separates accessible vs locked puzzles based on tier
- `canUserAccessPuzzle(userId, puzzle)` - Checks if user can access specific puzzle
- `getUnlockInfo(userId)` - Returns upgrade info for locked puzzles
- `addTierMetadata(puzzles, userTier)` - Adds tier information to puzzles for display
- `getTierOptions()` - Returns all subscription tier options for Pricing page

**Tier Configuration**:
```javascript
TIER_CONFIG = {
  free: { teaserCount: 1, maxWeeks: null },
  one_time: { maxWeeks: 1 },
  monthly: { maxWeeks: 4 },
  quarterly: { maxWeeks: 12 },
  annual: { maxWeeks: 52 }
}
```

## üîå Integration Points

### Dashboard.js (Updated)

**New Imports**:
```javascript
import tierBasedPuzzleService from '../services/tierBasedPuzzleService';
import UpgradePrompt from '../components/UpgradePrompt';
```

**New State**:
```javascript
const [userTier, setUserTier] = useState('free');
const [puzzlesWithTier, setPuzzlesWithTier] = useState({
  weakness: { accessible: [], locked: [] },
  mistake: { accessible: [], locked: [] },
  opening: { accessible: [], locked: [] },
  endgame: { accessible: [], locked: [] }
});
```

**Changes to loadPuzzles()**:
- After loading puzzles from Supabase, applies tier-based filtering
- Separates puzzles into `accessible` (teasers + user-tier eligible) and `locked`
- Updates userTier state for banner display
- Maintains persistence via PuzzleDataContext

**Updated renderPuzzleSection()**:
- Now takes only `category` parameter (simplified)
- Displays accessible puzzles with green border and teaser badge
- Shows locked puzzles with blurred board and "Unlock" button
- Displays UpgradePrompt for free users with locked puzzles
- Shows puzzle count by status (‚úÖ Unlocked / üîí Locked)

**Subscription Banner**:
- Shows different message based on `userTier`:
  - Free (unused): "Generate your first report"
  - Free (used): "1 teaser per category - Upgrade to unlock full sets"
  - Paid: Shows tier name + description

## üé® UI/UX Changes

## üîÑ How It Works

### User Journey

1. **Free User (First Time)**:
   - Generates first report ‚Üí Gets teasers only (1 per category)
   - Dashboard shows: 1 teaser puzzle unlocked
   - Other puzzles appear grayed out with lock icon
   - UpgradePrompt encourages subscription

2. **Free User (After Free Report Used)**:
   - Banner changes to "Limited to 1 teaser per category"
   - Can see locked puzzles but can't access them
   - Multiple upgrade options suggested

3. **One-Time Pack User** ($4.99):
   - Immediate access to 1 week of puzzles (all 4 categories)
   - After 1 week: puzzles expire, locked again
   - Prompted to subscribe for continuous access

4. **Monthly Subscriber** ($6.99):
   - Accesses 4 weeks of weekly puzzles
   - New puzzles generated each week
   - Renewal: access continues
   - Shows "Monthly Plan Active" badge

5. **Quarterly Subscriber** ($18.99):
   - Accesses 12 weeks of puzzles
   - Same weekly generation as monthly
   - Better rate than month-to-month

6. **Annual Subscriber** ($59.99):
   - Full year (52 weeks) access
   - "Priority new features" badge
   - 40% savings vs monthly
   - Shows "Annual Plan Active"

## üîê Access Control Logic

### Puzzle Accessibility Check
```
IF puzzle.is_teaser:
  ‚úÖ Always accessible (all tiers)
ELSE IF user_tier == 'free':
  ‚ùå Locked (show teaser only)
ELSE IF user_tier in ['one_time', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'annual']:
  ‚úÖ Check if puzzle within allowed week window
  IF within window:
    ‚úÖ Accessible
  ELSE:
    ‚ùå Locked (expired or future puzzle)
```

---

## üìä Data Flow

```
Dashboard (Load Puzzles)
    ‚Üì
puzzleAccessService.getPuzzlesByCategory()  [Get from Supabase]
    ‚Üì
tierBasedPuzzleService.filterPuzzlesByTier()  [Apply tier filtering]
    ‚Üì
Separate into:
  - accessible[] (show fully)
  - locked[] (show preview/locked)
  - tierInfo (user's tier)
    ‚Üì
setPuzzlesWithTier() [Store in state]
    ‚Üì
renderPuzzleSection(category) [Display by tier]
```

---

## üîó Integration with Existing Services

### subscriptionService.js
- Already tracks user tier and expiration
- `getSubscriptionStatus(userId)` returns tier info
- Returns tier: 'free', 'one_time', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'annual'
- Already integrated with Stripe

### puzzleAccessService.js
- `getPuzzlesByCategory()` - Gets puzzles from Supabase
- `storePuzzlesBatch()` - Stores with `is_teaser` flag
- Tier service builds on top without modifying existing logic

### userProfileService.js
- Continues to manage user profiles
- Subscription status tracked there as well
- Tier service queries subscriptionService primarily

## üìã Database Schema Assumptions

Your `puzzles` table should have:
```
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID) 
- is_teaser (boolean) - marks free preview puzzles
- is_locked (boolean) - legacy field, still used
- unlock_tier (string) - tier required (free/monthly/etc)
- category (string) - weakness/mistake/opening/endgame
- fen (string) - chess position
- title/objective (string)
- theme (string)
- week_number (integer) - optional, for weekly tracking
- year (integer) - optional, for weekly tracking
```

## üìû Support

The system uses `subscriptionService` which already handles:
- Stripe integration
- Payment processing
- Subscription renewal
- Cancellation handling

The tier-based service only:
- Reads subscription status
- Filters puzzles accordingly
- Displays UI based on tier

No payment logic needed here‚ÄîStripe handles it!
