## Test 1: Generate New Report and Verify IndexedDB Caching

### Steps:
1. **Open browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Generate a new report** for any chess.com or lichess username
4. **Wait for report generation to complete**
5. **Look for these console logs:**

```
✅ Expected Console Output:

📊 Generating 30 puzzles per category (weakness, mistake, opening, endgame)
📊 Generated puzzles: {weakness: 30, mistake: 30, opening: 30, endgame: 30}
💾 Cached 30 mistake puzzles in IndexedDB
💾 Cached 30 weakness puzzles in IndexedDB
💾 Cached 30 opening puzzles in IndexedDB
💾 Cached 30 endgame puzzles in IndexedDB
💾 Loading puzzles from IndexedDB and storing to Supabase...
📊 Prepared 120 total puzzles from IndexedDB: {weakness: 30, mistake: 30, opening: 30, endgame: 30}
✅ Stored 120 puzzles with full data in Supabase
```

### ✅ Pass Criteria:

```json
{
  "puzzles": [
    // Array of 30 puzzle objects
    {
      "id": "...",
      "position": "rnbqkbnr/...",
      "fen": "rnbqkbnr/...",
      "solution": "...",
      "lineUci": "...",
      // ... more fields
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Fix My Weaknesses",
    "subtitle": "Puzzles targeting your weak areas",
    "description": "Practice positions designed to improve your weaknesses."
  },
  "savedAt": 1234567890
}
```

### ✅ Pass Criteria:
- All 4 keys exist
- Each key has `puzzles` array with ~30 items
- Each key has `metadata` object
- Each key has `savedAt` timestamp

## Test 3: Verify Puzzle Pages Load Correctly

### Steps:

#### 3.1 Test "Fix My Weaknesses"
1. **Click "Fix My Weaknesses"** button on report page
2. **Verify URL:** `/puzzle/fix-weaknesses`
3. **Check:**
   - ✅ Puzzles load (no "No puzzles found" message)
   - ✅ Chess board displays
   - ✅ Puzzle counter shows (e.g., "Puzzle 1 of 30")
   - ✅ Can navigate between puzzles

#### 3.2 Test "Learn From Mistakes"
1. **Click "Learn From Mistakes"** button on report page
2. **Verify URL:** `/puzzle/learn-mistakes`
3. **Check:**
   - ✅ Puzzles load (should already work)
   - ✅ Chess board displays
   - ✅ Puzzle counter shows
   - ✅ Can navigate between puzzles

#### 3.3 Test "Master My Openings"
1. **Click "Master My Openings"** button on report page
2. **Verify URL:** `/puzzle/master-openings`
3. **Check:**
   - ✅ Puzzles load (no "No puzzles found" message)
   - ✅ Chess board displays
   - ✅ Puzzle counter shows (e.g., "Puzzle 1 of 30")
   - ✅ Can navigate between puzzles

#### 3.4 Test "Sharpen My Endgame"
1. **Click "Sharpen My Endgame"** button on report page
2. **Verify URL:** `/puzzle/sharpen-endgame`
3. **Check:**
   - ✅ Puzzles load (no "No puzzles found" message)
   - ✅ Chess board displays
   - ✅ Puzzle counter shows (e.g., "Puzzle 1 of 30")
   - ✅ Can navigate between puzzles

### ✅ Pass Criteria:
- All 4 puzzle pages load successfully
- Each page shows ~30 puzzles
- No errors in console
- Can interact with puzzles (make moves, see solutions)

## Test 4: Verify Supabase Storage

### Steps:
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to:** Table Editor → `puzzles` table
3. **Filter by:** `user_id = {your_user_id}`
4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ ~120 puzzle records exist
   - ✅ Records have `category` field: 'weakness', 'mistake', 'opening', 'endgame'
   - ✅ Records have `puzzle_data` JSONB column with full puzzle object
   - ✅ Records have `index_in_category` (0-29)
   - ✅ Records have `fen` field populated

### Example Query:
```sql
SELECT 
  category, 
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN report_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as orphaned
FROM puzzles 
WHERE user_id = '{your_user_id}'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY category;
```

### ✅ Expected Result:
```
category  | count | orphaned
----------|-------|----------
endgame   |  30   |    ?
mistake   |  30   |    ?
opening   |  30   |    ?
weakness  |  30   |    ?
```

**Note:** `orphaned` count depends on whether reportId fix is implemented. With current fix, puzzles may still have `report_id = null`.

## Test 5: Persistence Test (Reload Page)

### Steps:
1. **Navigate to any puzzle page** (e.g., `/puzzle/fix-weaknesses`)
2. **Verify puzzles load**
3. **Solve a few puzzles** (move to puzzle 3 or 4)
4. **Refresh the page** (F5)
5. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Puzzles still load (from IndexedDB cache)
   - ✅ Progress is maintained (still on same puzzle)
   - ✅ No re-generation needed

### ✅ Pass Criteria:
- Puzzles load instantly after refresh
- No network delay
- Console shows: `♻️ Reusing cached puzzles for this session`

---

## Test 6: Cross-Device Test (Optional)

### Steps:
1. **Generate report on Device A** (e.g., desktop)
2. **Open same account on Device B** (e.g., mobile)
3. **Navigate to Dashboard**
4. **Check if puzzles appear** (depends on reportId fix)

### ✅ Pass Criteria:
- Puzzles should appear on Dashboard if reportId is set correctly
- If not, this is expected (separate issue)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "No puzzles found" on puzzle pages
**Cause:** IndexedDB cache not created  
**Solution:**
1. Check console for errors during puzzle generation
2. Verify IndexedDB keys exist (Test 2)
3. Clear IndexedDB and regenerate report

### Issue 2: Only "Learn From Mistakes" works
**Cause:** Old code still running (cache issue)  
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart development server

### Issue 3: Console shows "Failed to store puzzles in Supabase"
**Cause:** Supabase connection issue or validation error  
**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase credentials
2. Verify `puzzleAccessService.storePuzzlesBatchWithFullData()` is working
3. Check if puzzles have required fields (fen, category)

### Issue 4: Puzzles load but board doesn't display
**Cause:** Missing FEN or invalid position  
**Solution:**
1. Check puzzle data in IndexedDB
2. Verify `fen` or `position` field exists
3. Check console for chess.js errors
