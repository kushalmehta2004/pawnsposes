# üß™ Dashboard Puzzle Display - Testing Guide

## What Changed?

We simplified the puzzle storage flow so that **all 4 puzzle categories** now display correctly on the Dashboard.

### Previous Issue:
- Only "Learn From Mistakes" was showing puzzles on Dashboard
- Other 3 categories (Weakness, Opening, Endgame) were empty

### Root Cause:
- Puzzles were being saved to Supabase **before** the report was created
- This resulted in puzzles with `report_id = null`
- Dashboard queries filtered by `report_id`, so these orphaned puzzles didn't show up

### Solution:
- **Step 1:** Generate puzzles and cache in IndexedDB (ReportDisplay.js)
- **Step 2:** When PDF is generated, load puzzles from IndexedDB and save to Supabase with valid `report_id` (FullReport.js)
