**USER PROMPT**
Analyze the games of the user '[Username]', who plays on [Platform]. 
The games are provided below in structured JSON format. 
Each game contains:
- Player names and ratings
- Game result
- Opening ECO code and name (if available)
- Critical FEN positions: these are only from key moments such as strategic errors, positional inaccuracies, or major turning points
- Move number and move played for each FEN
- Phase of the game (opening, middlegame, endgame)

Base all of your conclusions ONLY on the provided FEN positions and metadata. 
Do not invent moves, positions, or evaluations.

**ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:**

1. **Executive Summary:**
   - Write a short, encouraging but blunt paragraph (4–6 sentences) summarizing the player's overall style and key themes from these games.
   - Mention their strongest area and their biggest recurring issue.

2. **Recurring Weaknesses (exactly 3 items):**
   For each weakness:
   a. Give it a short, clear, and descriptive title (choose from relevant strategic/positional chess concepts such as: Outposts, Weak Squares, Pawn Breaks, Pawn Tension, Trading Good vs Bad Pieces, Exchange Sacrifice, Counterattack, Static Weakness, Dynamic Weakness, Blockade, Space Advantage, Minority Attack, Isolated Pawn, Passed Pawn, Evaluating the Position, Improving Pieces, Candidate Moves, Visualization, Clearance, Quiet Move, Control of Key Squares, King Safety, Doubled Pawns, Hanging Pawns, Backward Pawns, Pawn Chains, Prophylaxis, Initiative, Restriction, Domination, Strong vs Weak Bishop, Bishop vs Knight, Avoiding Exchanges, Centralization, Exploiting Open Files, Principle of Two Weaknesses, etc.)
   b. Explain WHY this is a recurring weakness, focusing on long-term strategic or positional consequences rather than single-move blunders.
   c. Give 3 concrete examples from the games. For each example:
      - Include game number
      - Move number
      - Move played (e.g., `15...g5?`)
      - Corresponding FEN string
      - Short explanation of why this was strategically wrong and what plan should have been followed instead.
   d. Suggest a superior plan for each example, including future ideas (e.g., "Prepare to exchange the dark-squared bishop in order to weaken the opponent's dark squares permanently, leading to a favorable endgame").

3. **Middlegame Mastery Focus:**
   a. Summarize the player's typical middlegame plans. Are they coherent? Do they correctly choose the right side of the board to play on?
   b. Identify ONE middlegame concept they most urgently need to study, chosen from the strategic themes list above.

4. **Endgame Technique Review:**
   a. Assess their technique in the endgames from the dataset. Comment on whether they confidently convert advantages or defend tough positions well.
   b. Recommend ONE specific endgame skill to practice (e.g., Lucena Position, Opposition, Active Rook vs Passive Rook, Bishop vs Knight Endgames, Outside Passed Pawn, Triangulation, Zugzwang, Convert One Advantage, etc.).

5. **Actionable Improvement Plan:**
   a. Provide a 3-step personalized checklist for what the player should focus on in their next 10 games to address their weaknesses.
   b. Suggest ONE specific, highly relevant YouTube video (real title + creator) that directly addresses their main weakness.
   c. Suggest ONE classic master game (with players and year) that perfectly illustrates a key improvement concept they need.

**STYLE & OUTPUT RULES:**
- Be concise and data-driven. Avoid fluff or filler text.
- All claims must be supported by at least one provided FEN example.
- Do not include any moves or positions not present in the input.
- Use an encouraging but direct tone — praise where deserved, but be clear about what needs fixing.
- Output in valid JSON format using the following keys:
