## Debugging Tips

### Check If Gemini Data Exists
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Type: `document.__debugData?.analysis?.pawnsposesAI?.improvementPlan?.youtubeVideo`
3. Should show `{ title: "...", creator: "..." }` if available

### Monitor Verification in Real Time
1. Filter console by `verifyGemini` keyword
2. All logs related to verification will appear
3. Shows success/failure for each verification attempt

### Inspect Verified Video Object
1. Add breakpoint in verification useEffect
2. Check `verifiedGeminiVideo` state variable
3. Should contain: `{ title, creator, url, viewCount, duration, verified: true }`

### Check for Race Conditions
1. Rapidly switch between reports
2. Verify no ghost state updates
3. Look for "cancelled" messages in console

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass:** Video verification system is working correctly
2. **If some fail:** Check console logs and adjust criteria if needed
3. **If verification is too strict:** Lower view count threshold (currently 1000)
4. **If verification is too lenient:** Add more filters (e.g., minimum subscribers)
