## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. **`src/services/pdfService.js`** (Complete Rewrite)
- Uses `html2canvas` + `jsPDF` for precise control
- Creates optimized A4-formatted PDFs
- Converts interactive buttons to working links
- Preserves styling and layout
- Handles multi-page generation with proper scaling

**Key Features:**
```javascript
- generatePDFFromCurrentPage()     // Generates A4 PDF with working links
- uploadPDFToStorage()              // Uploads to Supabase
- generateAndUploadPDF()            // Complete workflow
- deletePDFFromStorage()             // Cleanup function
```

#### 2. **`src/pages/FullReport.js`** (Minor Update)
- Added `data-pdf-link` attribute to "Analyze on Lichess" button
- Stores the Lichess URL for PDF conversion
- Button continues to work normally in the web version

**Modified Button:**
```jsx
<button
  onClick={() => { /* opens in new tab */ }}
  data-pdf-link={`https://lichess.org/analysis/${...}`}
  // ... rest of styling
>
  Analyze on Lichess
</button>
```

3. Convert "Analyze on Lichess" buttons ‚Üí Clickable links
4. Preserve existing links (Positional Study, etc.)
