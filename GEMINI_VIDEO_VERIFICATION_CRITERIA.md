## Verification Checklist

### Pre-Verification Checks
- [ ] Gemini suggestion has `title` (not empty/null)
- [ ] Gemini suggestion has `creator` (not empty/null)

### YouTube Search Checks
- [ ] Search executed with both title AND creator
- [ ] At least one result returned from YouTube API

### Video Quality Checks (MUST ALL PASS)

| Check | Criterion | Value | Reason |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Embeddable | `embeddable !== false` | TRUE | Video can be played on our site |
| Region Restricted | No region restrictions | FALSE | Accessible worldwide |
| Duration | ‚â• 120 seconds | 2 min | Real content, not Shorts |
| Popularity | ‚â• 1000 views | 1K | Credible video |
| Live Stream | `live !== true` | FALSE | Stable, permanent content |

### Ranking Algorithm (Priority Order)
1. **Channel Name Match** (Primary)
   - Exact or substring match with Gemini's suggested creator
   - Case-insensitive comparison
   - Example: "GothamChess" matches "gothamchess", "Gotham Chess"

2. **Title Similarity** (Secondary)
   - Fuzzy word-boundary matching
   - Words > 3 characters only
   - Example: "Sicilian Defense Basics" matches "Sicilian Defense COMPLETELY Explained"
   - Similarity Score = Common words / Total words

3. **View Count** (Tertiary)
   - Higher view count = more credible
   - Used only when channel and title are equal

### Example Ranking

**Scenario:** User weak in "Sicilian Defense" by GothamChess

Gemini Suggests:
```
title: "Sicilian Defense Basics"
creator: "GothamChess"
```

YouTube Search Results (after filtering):

| Rank | Video Title | Channel | Views | Channel Match | Title Sim | Score |
|------|------------|---------|-------|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sicilian Defense COMPLETELY Explained | GothamChess | 245K | ‚úì | 75% | 9.8 |
| 2 | How to Play Sicilian Defense | LearnChess | 18K | ‚úó | 60% | 8.2 |
| 3 | Sicilian Basics for Beginners | agadmator | 156K | ‚úó | 80% | 8.5 |

**Selected:** #1 (GothamChess match takes priority)

## Detailed Filter Logic

### Filter 1: Embeddable Status
```javascript
if (!x.embeddable) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Video "${x.title}" is not embeddable (restricted)`);
  return false;
}
```
**Reason:** YouTube sometimes embeds videos with restrictions (age gates, consent, etc.)

### Filter 2: Region Restrictions
```javascript
if (x.regionRestricted) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Video "${x.title}" has region restrictions`);
  return false;
}
```
**Reason:** Video might not be accessible in all regions

### Filter 3: Duration (2 min minimum)
```javascript
if (x.durationSec < 120) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Video "${x.title}" is too short (${x.durationSec}s)`);
  return false;
}
```
**Reason:** Educational content should be substantial, not short clips/Shorts

### Filter 4: View Count (1000 minimum)
```javascript
if (x.viewCount < 1000) {
  console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è Video "${x.title}" has low view count (${x.viewCount})`);
  return false;
}
```
**Reason:** Popular videos are more likely to be legitimate/quality content

## Similarity Matching Algorithm

### Title Matching
```javascript
const geminiBits = geminiTitle.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3);
const titleBits = title.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3);
const commonWords = geminiBits.filter(w => 
  titleBits.some(t => t.includes(w) || w.includes(t))
);
const titleSimilarity = commonWords.length / Math.max(geminiBits.length, 1);
```

**Examples:**

1. Gemini: "Sicilian Defense Basics"
   - Bits: ["sicilian", "defense", "basics"]
   - YouTube: "Sicilian Defense COMPLETELY Explained"
   - Common: ["sicilian", "defense"] = 2/3 = 67%

2. Gemini: "King and Pawn Endgame"
   - Bits: ["king", "pawn", "endgame"]
   - YouTube: "King and Pawn Endgames Explained"
   - Common: ["king", "pawn", "endgame"] = 3/3 = 100%

3. Gemini: "Rook vs Knight"
   - Bits: ["rook", "knight"]
   - YouTube: "How to Handle Rook vs Knight in Endgames"
   - Common: ["rook", "knight"] = 2/2 = 100%

### Channel Matching
```javascript
channelMatch: channelTitle.toLowerCase().includes(geminiCreator.toLowerCase()) || 
             geminiCreator.toLowerCase().includes(channelTitle.toLowerCase())
```

**Examples:**
- ‚úì GothamChess ‚Üî gothamchess
- ‚úì GothamChess ‚Üî Gotham Chess  
- ‚úì agadmator ‚Üî agadmator Antonio Radiƒá
- ‚úó GothamChess ‚Üî ChessNetwork
- ‚úó GothamChess ‚Üî Chess.com

## Failure Recovery Strategy

### If Verification Fails
1. Show original Gemini suggestion (non-clickable)
2. Add note: "Could not verify on YouTube"
3. Log details for debugging
4. Don't crash or block other content

2. Show helpful error message
3. Don't retry automatically (preserve quota)
4. Log API error for monitoring

### If Timeout Occurs
1. Verification times out after ~5 seconds
2. Treat as "not found"
3. Show unverified suggestion
4. User can manually search YouTube

## Quality Metrics

### Success Rate (Expected)
- Real, widely-known videos: 95-99% verification rate
- Niche videos: 70-85% verification rate
- Hallucinated videos: 0% verification rate

### False Positive Rate (Unwanted)
- Should be < 5% (videos that shouldn't be recommended)
- Filters protect against age-restricted, region-restricted, low-quality

### False Negative Rate (Missed Good Videos)
- ~10-15% of real good videos might not be found
- Due to title variations or search algorithm limitations
- Acceptable tradeoff for quality assurance
