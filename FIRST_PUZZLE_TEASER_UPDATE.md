# First Puzzle as Teaser - Dashboard Update

## Overview
Updated the dashboard to automatically display the **first puzzle from each category as a teaser** for free users, just like the teaser puzzles generated after a report submission.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **`tierBasedPuzzleService.js`** - Updated `filterPuzzlesByTier()` method

**What Changed:**
- Added logic to automatically mark the **first puzzle** in each category as a teaser for **free users only**
- The first puzzle is moved to the `accessible` array with `is_teaser: true` and `isTeaserPromo: true` flags
- Remaining puzzles continue to be filtered normally (accessible if tier permits, otherwise locked)

**Key Code:**
```javascript
// For free users: automatically mark first puzzle as teaser
let isFirstPuzzle = tier === 'free';

for (const puzzle of puzzles) {
  // ... existing teaser check ...
  
  // For free users: first puzzle becomes a teaser
  if (isFirstPuzzle && tier === 'free') {
    isFirstPuzzle = false;
    teasers.push({
      ...puzzle,
      is_teaser: true,  // ✅ Marked as teaser
      accessLevel: 'teaser',
      canAccess: true,
      isTeaserPromo: true  // Flag for UI distinction
    });
    continue;
  }
  
  // ... rest of filtering logic ...
}
```

### 2. **`Dashboard.js`** - Updated teaser badge check

**What Changed:**
- Updated the teaser badge display condition to include `puzzle.isTeaserPromo`
- Ensures promoted teasers show the 🎁 badge

**Before:**
```javascript
const isTeaserText = puzzle.isTeaser || puzzle.is_teaser ? '🎁 Teaser' : '';
```

**After:**
```javascript
const isTeaserText = (puzzle.isTeaser || puzzle.is_teaser || puzzle.isTeaserPromo) ? '🎁 Teaser' : '';
```

## How It Works

### Filtering Flow
```
Dashboard loads puzzles from Supabase
    ↓
tierBasedPuzzleService.filterPuzzlesByTier()
    ↓
If user tier === 'free':
  - First puzzle → Mark as teaser
  - Move to `accessible` array with 🎁 badge
  - Remaining puzzles → Lock as usual
Else:
  - Apply normal tier-based access rules
    ↓
Display:
  - ✅ Unlocked section: Report teasers + first puzzle teaser
  - 🔒 Locked section: Remaining puzzles (preview first 3)
```

### Access Control
- **First puzzle**: Has `is_teaser: true` + `isTeaserPromo: true` 
- **Lichess button**: Works ✅ (puzzle is accessible)
- **No unlock needed**: Shows with green border
- **Shows badge**: "🎁 Teaser" displays
- **Other puzzles**: Lock/unlock rules unchanged

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No Breaking Changes**
- Existing report-generated teasers still work normally
- `is_teaser` flag properly set on promoted puzzles
- `canUserAccessPuzzle()` method works with promoted teasers
- Paid users unaffected (only free users get first puzzle as teaser)
- Rest of tier-based filtering unchanged

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Free user sees first puzzle from each category as teaser
- [ ] Teaser badge (🎁) displays on first puzzle
- [ ] First puzzle shows with green border (unlocked)
- [ ] "Solve on Lichess" button works for first puzzle
- [ ] Report-generated teasers still show correctly
- [ ] Remaining puzzles show as locked
- [ ] Paid users unaffected (all puzzles accessible by tier)
- [ ] Puzzle counts display correctly (Unlocked vs Locked)

---

## Benefits

✨ **User Engagement**
- Free users can explore and solve puzzles immediately
- Lower barrier to entry (see it works before upgrading)
- Same teaser experience as report-generated puzzles

✨ **Consistent Experience**
- All teasers shown identically (🎁 badge)
- Same unlock flow for non-teaser puzzles
- Familiar UI for users who've used reports

✨ **Simple Implementation**
- Single method update (no new logic needed elsewhere)
- Existing services work without modification
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## Configuration

To adjust this behavior, edit `tierBasedPuzzleService.js`:

```javascript
// To change how many teasers free users get:
let isFirstPuzzle = tier === 'free';  // Change to limit other tiers too

// Or modify the condition to always mark first puzzle as teaser:
if (isFirstPuzzle) {  // Remove the tier === 'free' check
  // ... promote to teaser
}
```

---

## Notes

- The first puzzle is determined by **order in the Supabase array** (typically sorted by creation date or relevance)
- Promoted teasers are flagged with `isTeaserPromo` to distinguish from explicit teasers if needed
- The promotion only affects free users; paid tiers see all puzzles normally
