# Gemini Video Verification - Quick Reference

## What Changed?

### Problem Solved
‚ùå **Before:** Gemini suggested videos that didn't actually exist on YouTube
‚úÖ **After:** All suggested videos are verified to exist and be accessible

### Key Improvement
- **Verification:** Videos are now checked against YouTube API before display
- **No Hallucinations:** Only real, currently available videos are linked
- **Accessibility:** Region-restricted and age-restricted videos are automatically rejected
- **Quality:** Videos must have minimum views and duration

## Files Modified

### 1. `youtubeSearchService.js`
**Location:** `c:\pawnsposes\src\services\youtubeSearchService.js`

**Change:** Added new export function
```javascript
export const verifyGeminiVideoSuggestion = async (title, creator) => {
  // Verifies video exists on YouTube
  // Returns: { title, creator, url, viewCount, duration, verified: true }
  // OR: null if not found/accessible
}
```

**Lines:** 260-399

### 2. `FullReport.js`
**Location:** `c:\pawnsposes\src\pages\FullReport.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added 2 new state variables (lines 53-55)
2. Added verification useEffect (lines 103-144)
3. Updated content loading check (lines 259)
4. Updated UI display (lines 2018-2068)

---

## How It Works (Simple Flow)

```
1. Gemini analyzes games ‚Üí suggests video
2. FullReport displays Gemini suggestion
3. New useEffect triggers ‚Üí calls verification function
4. Verification function searches YouTube
5. Filters results by: embeddable, region, duration, views
6. Returns verified video with YouTube link
7. UI updates to show clickable link (if verified)
   OR shows unverified message (if not found)
```

---

## Component State Variables

### New State Added
```javascript
const [geminiVideoSuggestion, setGeminiVideoSuggestion] = useState(null);
  // Original: { title: "...", creator: "..." }
  // From: analysis.pawnsposesAI.improvementPlan.youtubeVideo

const [verifiedGeminiVideo, setVerifiedGeminiVideo] = useState(null);
  // Verified: { title, creator, url, viewCount, duration, verified: true }
  // From: YouTube API verification

const [isVerifyingGeminiVideo, setIsVerifyingGeminiVideo] = useState(false);
  // Loading: true while verification is in progress
  // Used to show "‚è≥ Verifying..." badge
```

## Verification Criteria (9 Checks)

All must pass for video to be displayed as verified:

| # | Check | Must Be | Why |
|---|-------|---------|-----|
| 1 | Embeddable | YES | Can play on website |
| 2 | Region Restricted | NO | Accessible worldwide |
| 3 | Live Stream | NO | Permanent content |
| 4 | Duration | ‚â• 120s | Real content, not clips |
| 5 | View Count | ‚â• 1000 | Popular/credible |
| 6 | Channel Match | YES* | Correct creator |
| 7 | Title Match | YES* | Relevant content |
| 8 | Video Found | YES | Exists on YouTube |
| 9 | URL Available | YES | Can create link |

\* Uses fuzzy matching - doesn't need to be exact

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Valid video verified ‚Üí shows clickable link
- [ ] Invalid video rejected ‚Üí shows gray text
- [ ] Loading badge appears during verification
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Video link actually works on YouTube
- [ ] Metadata (views, duration) is accurate
- [ ] Works on different analyses
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully

---

## API Requirements

**YouTube API Needed:** YES
- Must have `REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Requires: YouTube Data API v3 enabled
- Cost: ~120 API units per verification (~83 verifications/day on free tier)

## Quick Debugging

### Video not verifying?
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify YouTube API key is valid
3. Check API quota hasn't been exceeded
4. Try searching for that video manually on YouTube

### Video verifying but wrong result?
1. Check "Title Similarity" percentage
2. Check "Channel Match" (true/false)
3. Verify metadata (view count, duration) is correct
4. Look at ranking in console output

### Verification taking too long?
1. Check network connection
2. Verify YouTube API is responding
3. Disable network throttling in DevTools
4. Check for blocked API calls

  - `x.durationSec < 120` (change to 60 for shorter videos)
  - `x.viewCount < 1000` (change to 100 for less popular videos)
  - Region restriction filter (remove to allow restricted content)

### To improve matching:
- Edit the ranking algorithm in lines 365-374
- Adjust priority of channel match vs title similarity
- Add custom creator whitelist
- Adjust title similarity calculation
