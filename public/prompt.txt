**ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:**

2. **Recurring Weaknesses (exactly 3 items):**
   For each weakness:
   a. Give it a short, clear, and descriptive title (choose from relevant strategic/positional chess concepts such as: Outposts, Weak Squares, Pawn Breaks, Pawn Tension, Trading Good vs Bad Pieces, Exchange Sacrifice, Counterattack, Static Weakness, Dynamic Weakness, Blockade, Space Advantage, Minority Attack, Isolated Pawn, Passed Pawn, Evaluating the Position, Improving Pieces, Candidate Moves, Visualization, Clearance, Quiet Move, Control of Key Squares, King Safety, Doubled Pawns, Hanging Pawns, Backward Pawns, Pawn Chains, Prophylaxis, Initiative, Restriction, Domination, Strong vs Weak Bishop, Bishop vs Knight, Avoiding Exchanges, Centralization, Exploiting Open Files, Principle of Two Weaknesses, etc.)
   b. Explain WHY this is a recurring weakness, focusing on long-term strategic or positional consequences rather than single-move blunders.
   c. Give 3 concrete examples from the games. For each example:
      - Include game number
      - Move number
      - Move played (e.g., `15...g5?`)
      - Corresponding FEN string
      - Short explanation of why this was strategically wrong and what plan should have been followed instead.
   d. Suggest a superior plan for each example, including future ideas (e.g., "Prepare to exchange the dark-squared bishop in order to weaken the opponent's dark squares permanently, leading to a favorable endgame").
