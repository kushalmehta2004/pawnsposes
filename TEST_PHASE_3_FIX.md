## 🚀 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Restart Your App
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 2: Generate a Report
1. **Make sure you're logged in!** ← Critical
2. Go to `/reports`
3. Fill in the form:
   - Platform: Chess.com or Lichess
   - Username: Your username
   - Games: 5 (for quick test)
4. Click "Generate Report"

### Step 3: Watch Console (F12)
You should now see **ALL 7 logs** in this order:

```
💾 Saving report to Supabase with subscription tracking...
📊 User subscription tier: free
✅ Report saved to Supabase with ID: [uuid]
✅ Reports generated counter incremented

## 🔍 Verify in Supabase

### Check Reports Table:
```sql
SELECT id, user_id, subscription_tier, is_weekly_report, created_at
FROM reports
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** New report with `subscription_tier = 'free'` and `is_weekly_report = true`

### Check Puzzles Table:
```sql
SELECT id, report_id, puzzle_type, is_weekly_puzzle, puzzle_data
FROM puzzles
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected:** New puzzles with:
- `report_id` matching your report
- `puzzle_data` containing full puzzle object (not null)
- `is_weekly_puzzle = true`

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Issue: Not seeing any logs
**Cause:** Not logged in  
**Solution:** Log in first, then generate report

### Issue: Seeing "⚠️ Missing userId or reportId"
**Cause:** Report didn't save (check for errors above this log)  
**Solution:** Check console for `❌ Failed to save report` error

### Issue: Puzzles not in Supabase
**Cause:** Check if you see `❌ Failed to store puzzles` error  
**Solution:** Check Supabase connection and table permissions

## 📊 What Phase 3 Does

When working correctly:

1. **Saves Report** → Supabase `reports` table with subscription tier
2. **Increments Counter** → `user_profiles.reports_generated` +1
3. **Generates Puzzles** → Creates 20+ puzzles from your games
4. **Stores Puzzles** → Saves complete puzzle objects to Supabase `puzzles` table
5. **Marks as Weekly** → Sets `is_weekly_puzzle = true` for subscription tracking
6. **Enables Dashboard** → Dashboard can now display puzzles from database

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once you see all 7 logs:
1. ✅ Phase 3 is working correctly
2. ✅ Puzzles are being saved to Supabase
3. ✅ Ready to move to Phase 4 (Dashboard UI)
